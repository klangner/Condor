Version 0.2

Document name type changed from [Char] to Data.Text. 
Total RAM: 155MB
But index.db on disk is the same


Version 0.1

Test set reuters-90/tests 
* Dataset: 4.4MB on disk
* index.db: 36MB
* RAM taken: 880MB
* search time for "aluminium": Very fast


This is very naive index implementation. It is just a starting point 
to help create structure of the program.
The full reuters-90 dataset can be indexed, but runs out of the memory on search.
